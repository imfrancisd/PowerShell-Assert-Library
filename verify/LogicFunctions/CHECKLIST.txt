STEP 1: Verify the help files
-----------------------------
The help files should be complete with a synopsis, description, and
examples. Be mindful of things that are difficult to test automatically,
such as clarity, tone, consistency, and choice of words and examples.

You can run the following scripts to display the help files:
    Verify-Test-All-Help.ps1
    Verify-Test-Exists-Help.ps1
    Verify-Test-False-Help.ps1
    Verify-Test-NotExists-Help.ps1
    Verify-Test-NotFalse-Help.ps1
    Verify-Test-NotNull-Help.ps1
    Verify-Test-NotTrue-Help.ps1
    Verify-Test-Null-Help.ps1
    Verify-Test-True-Help.ps1


STEP 2: Verify the examples
---------------------------
The examples in the help files must work.
