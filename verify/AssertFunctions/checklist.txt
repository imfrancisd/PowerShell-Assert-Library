Verify the help files
---------------------
The help files should be complete with a synopsis, description, and
examples. Be mindful of things that are difficult to test automatically,
such as clarity, tone, consistency, and choice of words and examples.

You can invoke the following scripts to display the help files:
    Verify-Assert-False-Help.ps1
    Verify-Assert-NotNull-Help.ps1
    Verify-Assert-Null-Help.ps1
    Verify-Assert-PipelineAny-Help.ps1
    Verify-Assert-PipelineCount-Help.ps1
    Verify-Assert-PipelineEmpty-Help.ps1
    Verify-Assert-PipelineSingle-Help.ps1
    Verify-Assert-True-Help.ps1
