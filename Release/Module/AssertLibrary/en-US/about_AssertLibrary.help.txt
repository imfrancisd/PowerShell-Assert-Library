SHORT DESCRIPTION
    A library of PowerShell functions that gives testers complete control over
    the meaning of their assertions. Well, at least that's the goal.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    A library of PowerShell functions that gives you a high degree of control
    over the meaning of your assertions.

    The control comes from being able to combine the functions in many
    different ways to create your assertions, or even to create your own
    assert funtions. Also, the functions are fully documented so you will not
    need to scour the script in order to guess what each function is supposed
    to do.

    Kinds of functions
    ------------------
    There are four kinds of functions in this library:
    * Assert Functions
    * Collection Functions
    * Comparison Functions
    * Logic Functions.

    Assert Functions
    ----------------
    The Assert Functions throw an error if some condition is not met.

    For example, you can:
    * assert that the result of a comparison is true
    * assert that a function returns nothing
    * assert that a predicate is true for all objects in a collection.

    Collection Functions
    --------------------
    The Collection Functions process collections.

    For example, you can:
    * pair up adjacent items in a list to assert that a list is sorted
    * zip multiple lists together to test them for equality
    * create the Cartesian product of multiple lists to generate test cases.

    Comparison Functions
    --------------------
    The Comparison Functions compares objects at a high level.

    For example, you can:
    * compare strings as programmatic strings or linguistic texts
    * compare the month, day, and year of two dates only if they are both UTC
    * compare two numbers only if their types are Int32, Int64 or Double, but
      their types don't have to match.

    Logic Functions
    ---------------
    The logic functions helps you avoid some quirks in the PowerShell language when you write predicates.

    Using the functions
    -------------------
    You can use these functions for different types of tests:
    * fully automated tests
    * semi-automated tests
    * exploratory tests.
