SHORT DESCRIPTION
    A library of PowerShell functions that gives testers complete control over
    the meaning of their assertions.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    A library of PowerShell functions that gives testers complete control over
    the meaning of their assertions.

    Kinds of functions
    ------------------
    There are three kinds of functions in this library:
    * Assert Functions
    * Collection Functions
    * Comparison Functions.

    Assert Functions
    ----------------
    The Assert Functions throw an error if some condition is not met.

    For example, you can:
    * assert that the result of a comparison is true
    * assert that a function returns nothing
    * assert that a function returns the correct number of objects.

    Collection Functions
    --------------------
    The Collection Functions process collections.

    For example, you can:
    * pair up adjacent items in a list to assert that a list is sorted
    * zip multiple lists together to test them for equality
    * create the Cartesian product of multiple lists to generate test cases.

    Comparison Functions
    --------------------
    The Comparison Functions compares objects at a high level.

    For example, you can:
    * compare strings as programmatic strings or linguistic texts
    * compare the month, day, and year of two dates only if they are both UTC
    * compare two numbers only if their types are Int32, Int64 or Double, but
      their types don't have to match.

    Using the functions
    -------------------
    You can use these functions for different types of tests:
    * fully automated tests
    * semi-automated tests
    * exploratory tests.
