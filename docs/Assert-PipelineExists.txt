NAME
    Assert-PipelineExists
    
SYNOPSIS
    Assert that a predicate is true for some objects in the pipeline.
    
SYNTAX
    Assert-PipelineExists -InputObject <Object> [-Predicate] <ScriptBlock> [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This function throws an error if any of the following conditions are met:
        *the predicate is not true for any object in the pipeline
    
    Note:
    The assertion will always fail if the pipeline is empty.
    
    *See the -InputObject and -Predicate parameters for more details.
    

PARAMETERS
    -InputObject <Object>
        The object that is used to test the predicate.
        
        Required?                    true
        Position?                    named
        Default value                
        Accept pipeline input?       true (ByValue)
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -Predicate <ScriptBlock>
        The script block that will be invoked for each object in the pipeline.
        
        The script block must take one argument and return a value.
        
        Note:
        The -ErrorAction parameter has NO effect on the predicate.
        An InvalidOperationException is thrown if the predicate throws an error.
        
        Required?                    true
        Position?                    1
        Default value                
        Accept pipeline input?       false
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    <CommonParameters>
        This cmdlet supports the common parameters: Verbose, Debug,
        ErrorAction, ErrorVariable, WarningAction, WarningVariable,
        OutBuffer, PipelineVariable, and OutVariable. For more information, see 
        about_CommonParameters (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216). 
    
INPUTS
    System.Object
    
    This function accepts any kind of object from the pipeline.
        
    
    
    
OUTPUTS
    System.Object
    
    If the assertion passes, this function outputs the objects from the pipeline input.
        
    
    
    
NOTES
    
    
        An example of how this function might be used in a unit test.
        
        #display passing assertions
        $VerbosePreference = [System.Management.Automation.ActionPreference]::Continue
        
        #display debug prompt on failing assertions
        $DebugPreference = [System.Management.Automation.ActionPreference]::Inquire
        
        $numbers = myNumberGenerator |
            Assert-PipelineExists {param($n) $n -is [system.int32]} |
            Assert-PipelineExists {param($n) $n % 2 -eq 0} |
            Assert-PipelineExists {param($n) $n -gt 0}
    
    -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 --------------------------
    
    PS C:\>@(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) | Assert-PipelineExists {param($n) $n -gt 3}
    
    
    Assert that at least one item in the array is greater than 3, and outputs each item one at a time.
    
    
    
    
    
    -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 --------------------------
    
    PS C:\>@() | Assert-PipelineExists {param($n) $n -gt 3}
    
    
    Assert that at least one item in the array is greater than 3, and outputs each item one at a time.
    
    Note:
    This assertion will always fail because the array is empty.
    
    
    
    
    
    -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 --------------------------
    
    PS C:\>@{a0 = 10; a1 = 20; a2 = 30}.GetEnumerator() | Assert-PipelineExists {param($entry) $entry.Value -gt 25} 
    -Verbose
    
    
    Assert that at least one entry in the hashtable has a value greater than 25, and outputs each entry one at a time.
    The -Verbose switch will output the result of the assertion to the Verbose stream.
    
    Note:
    The GetEnumerator() method must be used in order to pipe the entries of a hashtable into a function.
    
    
    
    
    
    -------------------------- EXAMPLE 4 --------------------------
    
    PS C:\>@{a0 = 10; a1 = 20; a2 = 30}.GetEnumerator() | Assert-PipelineExists {param($entry) $entry.Value -gt 25} 
    -Debug
    
    
    Assert that at least one entry in the hashtable has a value greater than 25, and outputs each entry one at a time.
    The -Debug switch gives you a chance to investigate a failing assertion before an error is thrown.
    
    Note:
    The GetEnumerator() method must be used in order to pipe the entries of a hashtable into a function.
